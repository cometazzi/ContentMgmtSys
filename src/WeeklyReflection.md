# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 1

08/26/2024 - some hours

Tasks Completed:
* Chose a project goal
* Though up problems and problem statement

My idea for the individual project is congealing somewhat in my head.  I have some ideas on how I will build it, but 
there are a lot of required technologies that I don't yet know or understand.  I expect that these technologies will
be a great help in creating applications once I get the hang of them.

I struggled a bit coming up with an idea- I was thinking of something like a personal Wiki, since I have a tendency to
dive deep into my own research projects (music, electronics, programming, cooking, storywriting, etc) but then shift 
gears away for some time.  Many times I've come back to a topic months or years later and end up having to go through a 
lot of the discovery and research I'd had before.  I'm better about keeping notes but I have hundreds of text documents
and files scattered about on at least three different computers.  I would like a central, searchable place to store all
this data and categorize it.  I felt like this isn't 'good enough' for the class project, however.

Another thought was to develop an inventory management system that will allow me to inventory and take stock on the 
tens of thousands of electronics components and parts that I've accumulated over the years.  I have dreamt of such a
thing for many years, but I had already used this idea in another class.  Also, I doubt it would be 'good enough' for 
Enterprise Java.

Looks like I'm stuck with the Document Management System!

### Week 2

09/01/2024 - 1hr

* Created this repository
* Wrote the problem statement
* Started documenting the project plan
* Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project
* Tried to boost my self-confidence

### Week 3

09/08/2024 - 0hr

* Busy week as I was catching up on other assignments and had a number of doctor's appointments

### Week 4

09/15/2024 - 5hr

* Created User Stories
* Created page headers 
* Copied and edited Project Plan
* Created list of MVP selections, though I wonder if my design consolidates too many things onto each page.  It seems
logical for a document management system to have the ability to do all CRUD operations in one or a few places.

* Created wireframes in Figjam. I am a machine-builder, not an artist.  Unfortunately.
